<h1>A short flarl poem about school work and what comes with it</h1>
<p> 
  School work<br>

  School work is what students need to learn<br> 
  Collaboration is key to getting things done<br>

  School work is very tiring and causes students to sleep<br>
  Why won't the school work ever end?<br>
  All I could think about is catching some Z's<br>

  School work is challenging and students often need help<br>
  Everything is always better when done with others<br>

  School work can be very fullfilling after being completed<br>
  Oh wait... It never truly ends.
